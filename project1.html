              When I heard about Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, the only things I knew about this subject were
              what was I had readon the news and in articles. Wanting to know more, I chose to pursue this in my
              coursework. I have opted for CS 428 - Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality as a part of my coursework.
              This project entails creating an Augmented Reality based project. The aim of this project is to be able to
              develop an Augmented Reality Application which will help us demonstrate our skills and understanding of
              Unity, Vuforia and 3-D modelling other tools available. We have been given two cubes, namely the <a

                Cube</a>, which can be downloaded from the links given. With these cubes we need to build AR objects on
              top of them in the form of attractions. The key physical attractions in this project are
              two cubes
              and a laptop sticker, where one cube holds the Statue of Liberty in New York and the other cube holds a
              stage of a Coldplay concert.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>Statue of Liberty (New York):</h3>
                <p>In the month May 2022, it was my first visit to the United States of America. I have always been
                  entrigued by the country and I was not at all disappointed. The mesmerising beauty of the Statue of
                  Liberty, along with the iconic Yellow Taxis were a highlight for me. Personally, I loved eating the
                  New York Cheescake as well. Hence, you can see where some of my model choices come from. I also intend
                  on visiting New York for Christmas, thus the elements of snow and christmas in the attraction.</p>
              </li> 
              <li>
                <h3>Coldplay Concert (Mumbai):</h3>
                <p>Mumbai is my home, a place where I have been born and brought. Before moving
                  to the United States to pursue my masters, in Mumbai I would attend various concerts to satiate my
                  love for music. I have tried to recreate the environment I experienced at a Coldplay concert. The
                  model
                  consistes of a stage and a singer along with lights and piano sounds, to recreate fireworks and music.
                </p>
                <h3>Laptop Sticker:</h3>
                <p>
                  I believe the laptop sticker must hold some significance to the person whose laptop is it. At the same
                  time I feel the AR laptop sticker can also add some additional utility. Hence I have added some of my
                  hobbies and a contact card on the Laptop Sticker.

      <h2>Future of AR & AR Eyewear</h2>
      <div class="row mb-3">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Imagine a near-future where everyone does not wear regular spectacles or goggles but rather AR-enabled
            eyewear. Fascinating? In my opinion, it is subjective. Techno-geeks like me could end up loving such eye
            wear as it expands the available information in a particular instant. At the same time there could be a
            whole section who simply would find such technology to be inconvenient them. Also, a user mind is a one that
            seeks utility rather than fancy technology, hence for AR eyewear to be ‘popular’ it would need to satisfy a
            consumer need rather than a fancy.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            For the popularity to increase, for AR eyewear that can show AR objects, it becomes imperative address some
            of the following concerns. Can the AR eyewear interfere with the real environment on-demand? Do the AR
            objects relay real information? And lastly, does the object need AR enhancements in the first place? I
            believe that AR eyewear will become popular albeit AR objects may not be required. There are certain use
            cases where AR eyewear could be beneficial like in medicine, or in manufacturing. This will lead to an
            increase in commercial use of the technology. Another useful use of this could be in tight spaces where
            there is not much physical space available to
            display some object. An example could be preschool kids using the cubes (used in this project) as
            educational tools. Life-like animations could be developed for animals or real world objects and displayed
            on these tiny cubes, instead of making a trip to the real zoo.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            One segment I believe this could be made popular is for individuals who have special needs. Individuals with
            lowered cognitive functions could simply wear these glasses, and have an array of guided information
            available to them. For example, if the individual does not know how to use a particular object, a guided AR
            tutorial could be displayed for the object or an explanation. This could be as simple as a small stop light
            for crosswalks, where if an individual looks at a red light, the immediate footpath will be coloured red.
            The only constraint of this would be the information should not confuse the individual rather than assist
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            AR eyewear could also help when it comes to small object. For an engineer who has to work with small parts,
            having an eyewear that on seeing this small part will magnify and highlight some key properties of the part
            could help. But since we also consider the future for our future. In a scenario where AR eyewear are
            equipped with high precision optics, we could use the technology to recreate microscopic things that are not
            visible to the naked human eye and make them visible. Scientists in labs could use this to study cultures,
            or microbes. Even general users could use this to see small objects, with specific applications (because not
            everything needs AR enhancements). Specific applications like Nature Apps could be developed so that humans
            could look at small insects like butterflies and have them magnified for their view.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            In conclusion, for the popularity and usefulness of these AR eyewear is heavily dependent on the utility that they provide and the amount of information gain they provide. The technologies still need to develop to be market ready.
