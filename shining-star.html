        <h3>Project by Advait Pai</h3>

        <h1>Phase 1 completion</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As a part of phase one, I have loaded the stars using a file called DataLoader.cs which is stored in the Assets folder. Once I load the stars, the same DataLoader.cs file contains the code logic to create constellations. For the scope of this submission I am only plotting <b>one</b> constellations. Additionally, in the GitHub repository (link below), the "data" directory contains the cleaning.ipynb which contains the cleaning logic.  </p>

          <h1>Steps to Reproduce:</h1>
          <div class="row mb-3">
            <div class="col-lg-12">
              <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Clone the repository from this <a href="https://github.com/advaitpai/CS528_AdvaitPai" target="_blank">GitHub Link</a>. The one minute walkthrough video is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/101lgJKSUS-feux-IiJXryZ9oHBQStHok/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <li>Open the downloaded folder.</li>
                <li>The data folder contains the cleaning.ipynb which contains the code written by me to clean the data. This can be directly viewd in the GitHub repository or using JupyterNotebook or Visual Studio Code. </li>
                <li>The omicron-unity directory contains the project I am developing for the CAVE2. It is a stripped down version of the Cube World Example.</li>
                <li>Download the <a href="https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive" target="_blank">Unity Version 2019.2.11f1</a> using Unity Hub. If you do not have <a href="https://unity.com/unity-hub" target="_blank">Unity Hub</a>, install that as well.</li>
                <li>Once downloaded, then in Unity Hub, click the "Add" button and then select the subfolder omicron-unity from the downloaded folder. It should automatically pickup the required Unity Version but if asked, choose the appropriate version.</li>
                <li>The project may take some time to load. Once the assets have been loaded, the Unity window will launch.</li>
                <li>In the "Assets" folder, there is a scene called "Stary Sky". Drag this scene, to the project hierarchy and delete the "Untitled" scene (or any other such scene). </li>
                <li>Once the "Stary Sky" scene is loaded, click the play button to see the stars and constellations. When loading, there maybe an error, ignore this for now. Both the "Play" and the "Pause" button will be selected due to this error. Unselect the "Pause" button and that should allow for the scene to be viewed.</li>
                <li>Since the single constellation being drawn is below the initialsol, the user will have to fly downward and maybe backward to be able to view the constellation. The constellation details are available in the console.</li>
                <li><b>Note:</b> For the initial scope of the project 107574 stars have been plotted using a simple sphere and applying shaders as materials. The constellation being drawn is the first constellation from constellationship.txt file. The code written for it can handle all 88 constellations but that has not been implemented for now. In the console, the user can view the 8 lines being drawn for the first constellation in the log output.</li>
